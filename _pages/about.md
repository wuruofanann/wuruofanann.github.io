I am a PhD student in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. With backgrounds in linguistics and psychology, my current research investigates bilingual/multilingual language use in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder.

Previously, I obtained a BA in Linguistics from City University of Hong Kong, with a thesis looking at age-related phonetic variations in Wu Chinese. After that, I got an MSc in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, with a thesis examining reading patterns in bilingual young adults.

My fascination with languages and multilingualism probably stemmed from the diverse kinds of languages I've had the chance to encounter - I was brought up in Beijing (Mandarin) and came to Hong Kong (Cantonese and [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Hong_Kong)) when I started my undergraduate studies, while my maternal and paternal families were from [Wuxi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi), Jiangsu (Northern Wu Chinese/Shanghainese) and [Xichang, Liangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan (Southwestern Mandarin, and [Nuosu Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuosu_language)), respectively. Later I also became interested in how neurodevelopmental conditions shape language.
