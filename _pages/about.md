I am a PhD student in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research interest broadly lies in neurodevelopmental language disorders and how language processing interacts with different aspects of cognition in such populations.
Previously, I obtained a BA in Linguistics from City University of Hong Kong, with a thesis looking at age-related phonetic variations in Wu Chinese. After that, I got an MSc in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, with a thesis examining reading patterns in bilingual young adults.

I was brought up in Beijing and came to Hong Kong when I started my undergraduate studies. My maternal and paternal families were from [Wuxi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi), Jiangsu (Dialect: Northern Wu Chiense) and [Xichang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan (Dialect: Southeastern Mandarin; and [Nuosu Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuosu_language)), respectively.
