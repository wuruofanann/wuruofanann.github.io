I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am broadly interested in bilingualism, the interplay between language and cognitive abilities, and language use in neurodevelopmental conditions.  My current research explores bilingual language use in neurotypical and neurodevelopmental individuals, including those with autism spectrum disorder.

I obtained a BA in Linguistics from City University of Hong Kong, with a thesis examining age-related phonetic variations in Wu Chinese. After that, I got an MSc in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, with a thesis examining reading ability in bilingual young adults.
