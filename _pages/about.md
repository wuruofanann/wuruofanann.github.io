I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am broadly interested in bilingualism, language and cognitive abilities, and language use in neurodevelopmental conditions.  My current research explores bilingual language use in neurotypical and neurodevelopmental individuals, including autism spectrum disorder.

I obtained a BA in Linguistics from City University of Hong Kong, with a thesis examining age-related phonetic variations in Wu Chinese. After that, I got an MSc in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, with a thesis examining reading ability in bilingual young adults.

A bit more about my (linguistic) background...
I was brought up in Beijing (Mandarin) and came to Hong Kong (Cantonese and [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Hong_Kong)) when I started my undergraduate studies, while my maternal and paternal families were from [Wuxi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi), Jiangsu (Northern Wu Chinese/Shanghainese) and [Xichang, Liangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan (Southwestern Mandarin, and [Nuosu Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuosu_language)), respectively. Growing up surrounded by different languages naturally sparked my interest in how bi/multilingualism shapes language use and cognition.
