I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. With backgrounds in linguistics and psychology, my current research investigates the interaction between bilingual language use and neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder.

I obtained a BA in Linguistics from City University of Hong Kong, with a thesis looking at age-related phonetic variations in Wu Chinese. After that, I got an MSc in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, with a thesis examining reading ability in bilingual young adults.

- A bit more about my background...
I was brought up in Beijing (Mandarin) and came to Hong Kong (Cantonese and [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Hong_Kong)) when I started my undergraduate studies, while my maternal and paternal families were from [Wuxi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi), Jiangsu (Northern Wu Chinese/Shanghainese) and [Xichang, Liangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan (Southwestern Mandarin, and [Nuosu Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuosu_language)), respectively. Growing up surrounded by different languages naturally sparked my interest in how bi/multilingualism shapes language use and cognition.
