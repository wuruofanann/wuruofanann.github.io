I am a PhD student in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research interest broadly lies in neurodevelopmental disorders and how language processing interacts with different aspects of cognition in such populations.
Previously, I obtained a BA in Linguistics from City University of Hong Kong, with a thesis looking at age-related phonetic variations in Wu Chinese. After that, I got an MSc in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, with a thesis examining reading patterns in bilingual young adults.

I was brought up in Beijing, while my maternal and paternal families were from [Wuxi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi), Jiangsu and [Xichang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan, respectively.
