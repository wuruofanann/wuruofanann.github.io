- I was brought up in Beijing (Mandarin) and came to Hong Kong (Cantonese and [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Hong_Kong)) when I started my undergraduate studies, while my maternal and paternal families were from [Wuxi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi), Jiangsu (Northern Wu Chinese/Shanghainese) and [Xichang, Liangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan (Southwestern Mandarin, and [Nuosu Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuosu_language)), respectively. Growing up surrounded by different languages naturally sparked my interest in how bi/multilingualism shapes language use and cognition.
- Aside from research, music is crucial in my life. I enjoy listening to J-Pop, C-Pop, Western classical music, and traditional Chinese music. I also play several musical instruments (though skilled at none). My dream is to become a polyglot and a multi-instrumentalist.
