- I was brought up in Beijing (Mandarin) and came to Hong Kong (Cantonese and [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Hong_Kong)) when I started my undergraduate studies, while my maternal and paternal families were from [Wuxi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wuxi), Jiangsu (Northern Wu Chinese/Shanghainese) and [Xichang, Liangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan (Southwestern Mandarin, and [Nuosu Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuosu_language)), respectively. Growing up surrounded by different languages sparked my interest in how bi/multilingualism shapes language use and cognition.
- I used to serve as a volunteer teacher at centers for children with special needs. I hope that, in addition to providing theoretical insights,  my research can offer practical implications for autistic individuals living in bilingual or multilingual societies.

I listen to rock, J-Pop, C-Pop, Western classical, and <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1M64y1z78p/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=b6fba74a6a116682dd6c0e0588ba3d3f">traditional Chinese music</a>. I also play several musical instruments (though skilled at none). I am actually intrigued by the interplay between music and language - My dream is to become a polyglot and a multi-instrumentalist.
